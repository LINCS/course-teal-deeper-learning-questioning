  <name>Section 2 - What is Deeper Learning through Questioning?</name>
  <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"&gt;In this course, you will learn about questioning strategies that teachers can use to promote critical thinking on the part of students.  You also will learn about ways to encourage students to use self-questions related both to the content and the process of learning. The effective use of self-questioning can help students become independent learners. You will see examples of both teacher-led questions and student self-questions that can be used in the adult education classroom to promote deeper student learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
