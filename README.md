# Course: TEAL Deeper Learning Through Questioning
This Moodle course is for Deeper Learning Through Questioning. Questioning is a powerful teaching approach. When teachers ask higher-order questions and give students opportunities to think critically and to develop deep explanations, learning is enhanced. Equally important as teacher questions are student self-questions. Self-questioning can guide learning and help students to monitor their progress. This course focuses on both teacher questioning and student self-questioning.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

* Identify teacher questions that promote student critical thinking
* Describe strategies for encouraging students to use self-questions
* Explain how teacher-led and student self-questions can lead to deeper learning
